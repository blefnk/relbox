## About Server Actions

- Server actions provide automatic validation, type safety, and API documentation
- Server code is never exposed to the client - only the function signatures
- Automatic OpenAPI documentation available at /api/docs (vite only at the moment)
- They can work alongside Tauri for enhanced functionality
- Functions automatically detect environment and use Tauri invoke when available
